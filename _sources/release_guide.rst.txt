FAQ for PyPI/GitHub release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q1. No conda-forge feedstock yet? Create one by following the instructions :ref:`here <create-feedstock>`.

Q2. Not a feedstock admin? Create an issue with the title/comment: ``@conda-forge-admin, please add user @username``. Example `issue <https://github.com/conda-forge/diffpy.pdffit2-feedstock/issues/21>`_.

Q3. Interested in pre-release? Please follow the instructions under the ``conda-forge: pre-release`` section :ref:`here <conda-pre-release>`_.



Instructions for GitHub repository contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you are ready for PyPI and GitHub release, please follow these steps:

1. In the repository, create an issue on GitHub with the "Release" option.

2. Check off all items in the first checklist for PyPI/GitHub release.

3. After PyPI/GitHub release, create a PR into the conda-forge feedstock. While doing so, check off items in the second checklist. See Appendix 1.
