How to release Python package
===============================

Overview
~~~~~~~~

This guide is written for those who have just cookiecuttered.

If you already have a conda package and if you are interested in just release a new version, read the instruction here.

PyPI/GitHub release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _release-instructions-contributor:

Make sure you have your package cookiecuttered. Otherwise, please start from the Getting started page :ref:`here <getting-started>`

#. In the repository, create an issue on GitHub with the "Release" option as shown below:

#. Check off all items in the first checklist for PyPI/GitHub release.

Instructions for Project Owner for release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _release-instructions-project-owner:

#. Review the checklist prepared by the contributor in the issue.

#. Ensure ``PYPI_TOKEN`` and ``PAT_TOKEN`` are configured at the org level. See Appendix :ref:`1 <pypi-token-setup>`, :ref:`2 <pat-token-setup>`, respectively.

#. Check the ``github_admin_username`` section in ``.github/workflows/build-wheel-release-upload.yml`` is that of the project owner.

#. In your terminal, run ``git checkout main && git pull upstream main`` to sync with the main branch.

#. Run the following::

    # For pre-release, use *.*.*rc* i.g. 1.0.0rc0
    # For release, use *.*.* i.g. 1.0.0
    git tag <version-number>
    git push upstream <version-number>

#. Done! Once the tag is pushed, visit the ``Actions`` tab in the repository to monitor the CI progress.

#. Comment ``GitHub/PyPI release done!`` or ``GitHub/PyPI pre-release done!`` in the release GitHub issue.

#. The contributor will make a PR into the conda-forge feedstock. Review and approve the PR.

#. Wait for the contributor to test the released package. The issue will be closed by the contributor.

2. Click ``Generate new token`` and choose the classic option.

3. Under ``Note``, write, "GitHub CI release"

4. Set the Expiration date of the token.

2. Click the ``Actions`` tab under ``Secrets and variables``.

3. Click ``New organization secret`` and add a new secret and name it as ``PAT_TOKEN``.

Appendix 3. How to host your package documentation online
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have API doc built and tested locally. Now you want to deploy your doc via i.e., ``https://diffpy.github.io/diffpy.utils`` using GitHub Pages.

#. Go to your ``Settings`` page in your repository and and click ``pages`` under ``Code and automation``.
#. Click ``Deploy from a branch`` under ``Source``. Below, choose ``gh-pages`` branch and ``/(root)`` and click ``Save``.
